      Dark Souls[c] is a 2011 action role-playing game developed by
      <u>Fromsoftware</u> and published by <u>Namco Bandai Games</u>. A
      spiritual successor to FromSoftware's Demon's Souls, the game is the
      second installment in the Souls series. Dark Souls takes place in the
      kingdom of Lordran, where players assume the role of a cursed undead
      character who begins a pilgrimage to discover the fate of their kind. A
      port for Microsoft Windows was released in August 2012, which featured
      additional content not seen in the original PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360
      versions. The content was released for consoles in October 2012 under the
      subtitle Artorias of the Abyss.

      <i>Gameplay</i>
    </h3>
    <p>
      Dark Souls is a third-person action role-playing game. A core mechanic of
      the game is exploration. Players are encouraged to proceed with caution,
      learn from past mistakes, or find alternative areas to explore. Dark Souls
      takes place in a large and continuous, interconnected environment,
      connected through a central hub area. The player character can travel
      between areas and explore various paths at will, although prerequisites
      must be met to unlock certain areas.

    <p>
      A central element to the gameplay of Dark Souls is the bonfire. Bonfires
      are scattered throughout the world and serve as checkpoints for each
      level. By resting at a bonfire, the player character is healed to full and
      regains all of the healing charges of their "Estus Flask."<br />They can
      also level up and perform other functions, such as attuning magic and
      repairing and upgrading equipment. However, resting at a bonfire respawns
      all of the world's enemies, except for bosses, mini-bosses, and friendly
      non-playable characters.

      The player character's interaction with the world of Dark Souls includes a
      great deal of combat. Combat includes melee attacks, various forms of
      defensive maneuvering, and magical abilities. For melee attacks, player
      characters have access to a wide array of high fantasy, medieval-style
      weaponryâ€”including swords, spears, maces, and fantastical weaponry such as
      magical swords, huge greatswords, and immense clubs. For defence, player
      characters have access to shields, armour, dodging, and parrying. For
      magic, which includes a wide variety of offensive and defensive abilities
      known as sorceries, miracles, and pyromancies, player characters do not
      use any form of mana as in most other fantasy RPGs. Instead, they gain a
      discrete number of uses for each attuned spell when resting at a bonfire.
      These various forms of combat all have tradeoffs, variations, and in-game
      costs associated with them. They can all be buffed or altered in some
      fashion through levelling, smithing, consumable items, magical rings, and
      new equipment.
